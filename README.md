# Envoys
Chests spawn randomly in the warzone.

## Features
- Random spawn locations for envoy chests.
- Use `/setenvoy` to set up an envoy chest.
- Replace the chest once they are done.

## Important Note
When setting positions in the Envoys.yml, if it's in the format `175.1931:65.819:93.9181`, change it to `175:65:93` for proper functionality. You can also use `/tp ~ ~ ~` after setting the envoy chest.

## Particle Effects
Particle effects have been added to enhance the envoy experience.

## PiggyCustomEnchants Integration
PiggyCustomEnchants support has been added to introduce custom enchantments.

## How to Use
1. Place envoy chests in the warzone.
2. Run `/setenvoy` to set up an envoy chest at your location.
3. Replace the chest once the envoy event is over.
